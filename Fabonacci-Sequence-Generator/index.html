            <p>The Fibonacci sequence, discovered by Leonardo of Pisa, consists of numbers starting with 0 and 1, where each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. This sequence, introduced in 1202, has roots in ancient Indian mathematics. Its prevalence in nature, seen in the spirals of shells and sunflowers, demonstrates its efficiency in biological structures. Additionally, its connection to the golden ratio, approximately 1.618, has influenced art and architecture, showcasing its aesthetic appeal. In mathematics, it appears in various contexts such as continued fractions and modular arithmetic, enriching our understanding of number theory. </p>
