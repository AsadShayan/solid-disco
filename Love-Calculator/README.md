- Click the "Calculate" button to calculate the love compatibility.
- You will be redirected to the result page (`index.html`) where the calculated result will be displayed.

### Result Page (`index.html`)

- Upon redirection from the love calculator page, the result of the love compatibility calculation will be displayed on this page.
- The result will show the love compatibility percentage between the entered names.
